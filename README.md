ITKGEB
======

The ITK logo inspired by the cover of the book: Godel, Escher and Bach

The original tcl script for the vtk GEB cube was written by Jim Miller and
Bill Lorensen in January 1998.

To run this tcl script, you need to build VTK with

VTK_WRAP_TCL:BOOL=ON

and run

VTK_BIN/bin/vtk vtkgeb.tcl
